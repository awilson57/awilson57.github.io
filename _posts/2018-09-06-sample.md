This is awilson57, otherwise known as Austin Wilson speaking, and I would like to talk about video games for a while.

## My love for video games.

I started playing video games on the original X-Box, although I only played single-player
(mainly becuase I didn't know I could play online), and this was around the time I was in
elementary school. When I first got X-Box live, and played multiplayer with my friends,
my love for gaming just grew. Throughout my years of gaming, I have transitioned between what 
type of games I like; but, now I mainly play rpg's, sports games, and fps games. I also mainly
play on my ps4, but I also sometimes play games on my pc. This was an extremely brief history
of my gaming life, and how much I love playing video games.
  
  Sincerely, awilson57
